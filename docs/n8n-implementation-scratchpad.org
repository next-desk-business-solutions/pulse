* Implementation Log

** 2025-07-16 - Starting Implementation
- Created deployment plan and implementation details
- Beginning implementation of n8n configuration
- Following established patterns from outline.nix
- Note: Timezone should be UTC, not America/New_York
- Note: Don't add resource limits to docker containers
- ✓ Created arion-compose.nix with n8n configuration
- ✓ Modified pulse flake.nix to include arion (host-managed deployment)
- ✓ Created n8n NixOS module (modules/system/linux/n8n.nix)
- ✓ Added nginx configuration for n8n.workwithnextdesk.com
- ✓ Fixed pulseProjectPath to use flake input instead of hardcoded path
- ✓ Added pulse input to dotfiles flake.nix
- ✓ Added n8n secrets to secrets.nix

** Implementation Complete
All components have been created and configured. The n8n deployment is ready for the following deployment steps:

1. Create the actual secret files using agenix:
   - `agenix -e secrets/n8n-encryption-key.age`
   - `agenix -e secrets/n8n-db-password.age`
   - `agenix -e secrets/n8n-basic-auth-password.age`

2. Deploy to newton:
   - `deploy .#newton`

3. Verify deployment:
   - Check https://n8n.workwithnextdesk.com
   - Test pulse project access in workflows
   - Verify database connectivity

The implementation follows the established patterns from outline.nix and integrates with the existing infrastructure including shared PostgreSQL and Redis instances.

** 2025-07-16 - Deployment Complete
- ✓ Committed n8n changes to pulse repository
- ✓ Created and pushed pulse repository to GitHub
- ✓ Updated pulse flake input in dotfiles
- ✓ Committed and pushed dotfiles with n8n configuration
- ❌ Deployment failed: Option conflict with NixOS built-in n8n service
- ERROR: services.n8n.enable already declared in NixOS modules

** 2025-07-16 - Switching to Native NixOS n8n Service
- ✓ Remove custom n8n.nix module
- ✓ Remove arion-compose configuration
- ✓ Use built-in NixOS n8n service with database configuration
- ✓ Configure pulse project access via systemd service overrides
- ✓ Updated pulse flake to remove arion dependencies
- ✓ Configured systemd service with secrets and pulse access
- ✓ Added n8n agenix secrets configuration to newton host
- ❌ First deployment failed: preStart script issues
- ✓ Fixed systemd service configuration and pulse access
- ✓ Added n8n subdomain to Cloudflare DNS
- ❌ Second deployment: n8n service still failing (resources error)

** Next Steps Needed:
1. Debug why n8n service is failing to start
2. ✓ Check if PostgreSQL database "n8n" exists or needs creation
   - Found: n8n database doesn't exist
   - Solution: Added automatic database creation service
3. Verify Redis connectivity to twenty-redis-1
4. Test n8n service configuration
5. Once service starts, verify https://n8n.workwithnextdesk.com access

** 2025-07-16 - Database Creation Fix
- ✓ Added systemd service n8n-db-init to automatically create n8n database
- ✓ Service waits for PostgreSQL container and creates database if missing
- ✓ Added service dependencies so n8n waits for database initialization

** 2025-07-16 - Nginx Configuration Fix
- ❌ Found nginx failing: "proxy_http_version" directive is duplicate
- ✓ Fixed: Removed duplicate proxy_http_version (already set by recommendedProxySettings)
- Root cause: ACME fails because nginx can't start due to config error
