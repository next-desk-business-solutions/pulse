* Implementation Log

** 2025-07-16 - Starting Implementation
- Created deployment plan and implementation details
- Beginning implementation of n8n configuration
- Following established patterns from outline.nix
- Note: Timezone should be UTC, not America/New_York
- Note: Don't add resource limits to docker containers
- ✓ Created arion-compose.nix with n8n configuration
- ✓ Modified pulse flake.nix to include arion (host-managed deployment)
- ✓ Created n8n NixOS module (modules/system/linux/n8n.nix)
- ✓ Added nginx configuration for n8n.workwithnextdesk.com
- ✓ Fixed pulseProjectPath to use flake input instead of hardcoded path
- ✓ Added pulse input to dotfiles flake.nix
- ✓ Added n8n secrets to secrets.nix

** Implementation Complete
All components have been created and configured. The n8n deployment is ready for the following deployment steps:

1. Create the actual secret files using agenix:
   - `agenix -e secrets/n8n-encryption-key.age`
   - `agenix -e secrets/n8n-db-password.age`
   - `agenix -e secrets/n8n-basic-auth-password.age`

2. Deploy to newton:
   - `deploy .#newton`

3. Verify deployment:
   - Check https://n8n.workwithnextdesk.com
   - Test pulse project access in workflows
   - Verify database connectivity

The implementation follows the established patterns from outline.nix and integrates with the existing infrastructure including shared PostgreSQL and Redis instances.
